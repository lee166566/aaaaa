    "### Page 1: BNKEA 5.875 Perp Q24\n",
    "\n",
    "**BNKEA Overview:**\n",
    "- **BNKEA**: This stands for Bank of East Asia, a prominent local bank in Hong Kong known for its large asset base. It is recognized for its diversified investments and comprehensive financial services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive Catalysts:**\n",
    "- **BNKEA 5.875 Perp Call in September 2024**: A perpetual bond, BNKEA 5.875% Perp, is anticipated to be called in September 2024. A bond call means that the issuer is redeeming the bond before its maturity date. This action is seen positively because:\n",
    "  - It indicates the bank’s confidence in its liquidity and financial health.\n",
    "  - A call at USD 650 million implies significant capital movement, positively impacting market sentiment.\n",
    "  - Helps improve the overall investment sentiment on BNKEA's subordinated debts, meaning investors may feel more secure about the bank's financial stability and future prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank’s Fundamentals:**\n",
    "- **Capital Buffer**: The bank has a sufficient capital buffer, meaning it has extra capital set aside beyond the minimum required. This buffer helps in absorbing potential losses and maintaining stability.\n",
    "- **Earnings Momentum**: Continued positive earnings are expected into 2023. This includes improving credit costs (expenses associated with loan defaults) which is a good indicator of financial health.\n",
    "- **Strategic Diversification**: The bank has been diversifying its investments away from traditional sectors (e.g., real estate) towards newer strategic sectors and green financing (e.g., renewable energy projects). This diversification reduces risk and aligns with global financial trends towards sustainability.\n",
    "- **Asset Quality**: The new strategy focusing on stable and diversified investments should help in stabilizing the quality of the bank’s assets in 2024, reducing the risk of bad loans or investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stable Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**\n",
    "- **CAR**: This is a measure of a bank's capital, used to protect depositors and promote stability and efficiency in financial systems. It is a ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets.\n",
    "- The CAR is expected to remain stable even if BNKEA retires more AT1 (Additional Tier 1) capital without issuing new ones. This indicates the bank’s strong capital position and ability to manage its capital effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks:**\n",
    "- **Asset Quality Deterioration**: A significant decline in the quality of assets (e.g., an increase in bad loans) could negatively impact the bank, especially given China’s financial tightening measures which may affect overall economic stability.\n",
    "- **Profitability Pressure**: Low interest margins can affect the bank’s profitability. With lower margins, it’s harder for the bank to generate income from its lending activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative Value (RV) of BNKEA Complex:**\n",
    "- **G-spread (bp)**: This is the yield spread of bonds over the government bond yield curve, measured in basis points (bp). It’s an indicator of the risk premium investors demand for holding corporate bonds over risk-free government bonds.\n",
    "- The chart compares the G-spread for different BNKEA bonds over the years, providing a visual representation of their relative value and perceived risk by the market.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Business Momentum and Productivity Initiatives:**\n",
    "- **New Issues of USD Bonds**: NAB has issued USD 16.4 billion worth of new bonds, demonstrating strong demand and confidence in the bank’s creditworthiness. These bonds are highly rated by major credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, and Fitch), indicating low credit risk.\n",
    "- **Positive Financial Metrics**: \n",
    "  - **Cash NPAT (Net Profit After Tax)**: Rose by 4.3%, driven by an 8.8% growth in Australian SME lending. This shows strong business performance and market position.\n",
    "  - **BDD (Bad and Doubtful Debts)**: Lower than expected, indicating improved credit quality and fewer bad loans.\n",
    "  - **Share Buybacks**: NAB’s share buybacks, particularly a planned $1 billion buyback, help increase shareholder value and demonstrate confidence in the bank’s financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ratings on Newly Issued USD Senior Bonds:**\n",
