    "### Slide 1: Introduction to Pairs Trading\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello everyone. Today, I will be discussing pairs trading, a market-neutral strategy designed to exploit the mispricing between two correlated assets. This strategy focuses on the relative movement of assets rather than the market's overall direction, allowing us to generate returns even in volatile market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading operates on the assumption that if two assets share similar characteristics and risk exposures, their behaviors should be similar. By betting on the reversion to historical trends, we can profit from the convergence of prices back to their equilibrium level. As shown in this graph, the mutual price differences between two assets are represented by the value of the spread, highlighting the key concept of this strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide 2: Cointegration Test\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To effectively implement pairs trading, we need to identify pairs of assets that have a strong long-term relationship, which we do using cointegration tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Johansen test is robust and can handle multiple time series, checking for several cointegrating relationships simultaneously. This is particularly useful when dealing with a portfolio of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Engle-Granger test performs a linear regression between two asset prices and then checks the residuals for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. It’s simpler and effective for analyzing pairs of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can see examples of high correlation but non-cointegrated series versus high correlation and cointegrated series. Using these tests, we can identify pairs that exhibit strong, stable long-term relationships, essential for our trading strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide 3: Test Framework and Pair Selection\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our framework for selecting and setting up trades involves several key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop Loss Threshold**: 2.5\n",
    "- **Exit Threshold**: 0.5\n",
    "- **Entry Threshold**: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct out-of-sample testing from June 2021 to June 2024 and in-sample testing from January 2013 to June 2021. We sort and select pairs based on the Johansen and Engle-Granger tests, ensuring high trading volume, small bid-ask spreads, and lower borrowing fees to maintain cost-effective and liquid trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach helps us systematically identify and validate pairs likely to exhibit mean-reverting behavior, forming the basis for our trading strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide 4: Position Sizing Methods\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"An important aspect of our strategy is position sizing, ensuring our portfolio remains balanced and neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beta Neutral**: We adjust position sizes to neutralize beta, taking larger positions in lower-beta stocks and smaller positions in higher-beta stocks. The formula used is: Ratio = 1 / (Beta1 + Beta2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volatility Neutral**: Positions are inversely proportional to the stock’s volatility. For instance, if Stock A is twice as volatile as Stock B, the investment in Stock A would be half that of Stock B. The formula is: Ratio = 1 / (Volatility1 + Volatility2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dollar Neutral**: Equal dollar amounts are invested in both long and short positions, simplifying risk management by balancing the dollar value of long and short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods help us maintain a balanced portfolio, minimizing risk while capitalizing on the relative movements of asset pairs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide 5: Back Testing Results\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let's look at the results from our back testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated numerous pairs and selected the top 8 based on their Sharpe ratios. The graph shows the cumulative PnL for these pairs, tracked over the out-of-sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We constructed a portfolio with an initial investment of $1000, selecting pairs sorted by Sharpe ratio. The portfolio’s performance was notable, with an annualized return of 8.13%, a maximum drawdown of 6.13%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics indicate that our strategy successfully generates consistent returns while managing risk, validating the effectiveness of our approach.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide 6: Future Enhancements\n",
    "**Speaker Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Finally, let's discuss potential future enhancements to our strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Cost**: Implementing more detailed transaction costs, including commission fees and financing charges, will provide a more accurate picture of net returns.\n",
    "- **Portfolio Construction**: Testing different portfolios with floating weights and pairs to explore more profitable options.\n",
    "- **Underlying Selection**: Expanding our methodology to include other asset classes such as commodities, foreign exchange, and cross-asset trades.\n",
    "- **Back Testing**: Conducting more robust back testing and scenario analysis to refine our strategy and provide more comprehensive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements aim to improve our strategy further, potentially increasing profitability and robustness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\"Thank you for your attention. This concludes my presentation on pairs trading and our cointegration-based strategy. I am now open to any questions you might have.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is detailed yet concise enough to fit within a 6-minute presentation, providing a clear explanation of the pairs trading strategy, cointegration tests, trade setup, position sizing, back testing results, and future enhancements."
